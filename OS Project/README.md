# 💬 Operating Systems Chat System  
### Shared Memory & Socket Programming Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates core Operating Systems concepts including:

- Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- Shared Memory
- Semaphores
- Multithreading
- Socket Programming (TCP)
- Client-Server Architecture

The system consists of two main implementations:

1️⃣ Shared Memory Chat (Local IPC)  
2️⃣ Socket-Based Chat (Network Communication)

Both console and GUI versions are implemented using Windows API.

## 🎬 Combined Demo

[Watch the Shared Memory and Socket implementations](demo/os-ipc-demo.mp4)

The video presents the Shared Memory implementation first, followed by the Socket-based implementation.

# 🧠 Part 1 – Shared Memory Chat (IPC)

## 🔹 Concepts Implemented

- Windows Shared Memory (CreateFileMapping)
- Memory Mapping (MapViewOfFile)
- Semaphore Synchronization
- Reader-Writer Model
- Multithreading
- WinAPI GUI

## 🔹 How It Works

- Processes communicate using a shared memory buffer.
- A named semaphore ensures synchronized access.
- Messages are written and read safely without race conditions.
- GUI version implemented using Win32 API.

# 🌐 Part 2 – Socket-Based Chat System

## 🔹 Concepts Implemented

- TCP Socket Programming
- Multi-client server
- Thread-per-client handling
- Mutex for shared resource protection
- Winsock2 API
- Client-Server architecture
- GUI and Console versions

## 🔹 Server Features

- Listens on port 54000
- Accepts multiple clients
- Broadcasts messages to all connected clients
- Removes disconnected clients safely

## 🔹 Client Features

- Connects to server
- Sends and receives messages
- Threaded receive handling
- GUI interface using WinAPI
