# Pharmacy Database Management System (SQL)

## 📌 Overview
This project is an academic database system designed to manage a pharmacy environment.  
It models real-world pharmacy operations including patients, doctors, medicines, suppliers, employees, and billing.

The system was implemented using SQL with proper relational schema design based on ERD and relational mapping.
