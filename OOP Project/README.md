# Mastermind Game – JavaFX (OOP Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Java implementation of the classic Mastermind game with a graphical user interface built using JavaFX.

The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated secret color code within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the system provides feedback in terms of Bulls (correct color & position) and Cows (correct color, wrong position).

---

## 🎮 Features
- Random unique color code generation
- Graphical User Interface using JavaFX
- Real-time feedback system (BULL & COW logic)
- Attempt tracking system
- Game restart functionality
- Input handling & validation
- Win / Lose state detection

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java
- JavaFX
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Event Handling
- Randomization
- Arrays & Boolean tracking logic

---

## 🧱 System Design

The project follows a clean separation of concerns:

- `MastermindGame` → Application launcher
- `GameLogic` → Handles game rules, feedback calculation, and state management
- `GameGUI` → Handles user interface and interaction

This modular design improves maintainability and scalability.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied
- Encapsulation
- Class abstraction
- Modular architecture
- State management
- Separation of logic and UI

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
2. Make sure JavaFX is properly configured
3. Run `MastermindGame.java`
