# 👻 Pacman AI – Search Algorithms Project

## 📌 Overview
This project implements Artificial Intelligence search algorithms and applies them in a Pacman-style game.

The project demonstrates both uninformed and informed search techniques, including:

- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
- A* Search Algorithm

The A* algorithm is integrated into the game to control the ghost’s movement intelligently.

## 🎮 Game Description

A Pacman-inspired grid-based maze game built using Pygame.

- Pacman is controlled by the player.
- The Ghost uses A* search to chase Pacman.
- Multiple difficulty levels affect ghost speed.
- Score increases when Pacman collects food.
- Game ends when Pacman wins or is caught.
